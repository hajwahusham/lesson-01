 but perhaps my favorite is this:
 A good book can give you a new way to interpret your past experiences.
Whenever you learn a new mental model or idea,
 you can runall of your old data points through a new program.
 You can learn new lessons from old moments.
 this is only true if you internalize
 and remember insights from the books you read.
 Knowledge will only compound if it is retained.
 what matters is not simply reading more books,
 but getting more out of each book you read.
